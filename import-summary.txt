ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
/media/hamza/Local Disk/Projects/apps/EnvayaSMS-master
                  -                                   

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* .gitmodules
* CONTRIBUTORS
* LICENSE
* NOTICE
* README
* ant.properties
* build.properties
* build.xml
* default.properties
* export.properties
* icons_license.txt
* proguard-project.txt
* proguard.cfg
* server/
* server/php/
* server/php/EnvayaSMS.php
* server/php/README.txt
* server/php/example/
* server/php/example/config.php
* server/php/example/log/
* server/php/example/log/.gitignore
* server/php/example/mms_parts/
* server/php/example/mms_parts/.gitignore
* server/php/example/outgoing_sms/
* server/php/example/outgoing_sms/.gitignore
* server/php/example/send_sms.php
* server/php/example/send_sms_amqp.php
* server/php/example/server.php
* server/php/example/www/
* server/php/example/www/gateway.php
* server/php/example/www/gateway_amqp.php
* server/php/example/www/test.html

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/commons-cli-1.1.jar => app/libs/commons-cli-1.1.jar
* libs/commons-io-1.2.jar => app/libs/commons-io-1.2.jar
* libs/httpmime-4.1.2.jar => app/libs/httpmime-4.1.2.jar
* libs/rabbitmq-client.jar => app/libs/rabbitmq-client.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
